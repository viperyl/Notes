## Sound filed

The transition between near-field and far-field occurs at t distance `N` called natural focus of a flat transducer
$$
\Large N = \frac{D^2}{4\lambda}\;\;\;\;\;N = \frac{D^2F}{4V}
$$
$\bold{D}$ is the diameter of the traducer

$\bold{F}$ is the frequency of the transducer

$\bold{\lambda}$ is the wavelength

$\bold{V}$ is the velocity of sound in the material



## Ultrasonic sensor

#### Feature

Typical frequency: 40 kHz - 180 kHz, lower frequency correspond to longer measuring range.

Range: 12 cm - 5 m

Resolution:  ~2 cm

Sound beam angle: 20 - 40 degrees

#### Application

low speed scenario



#### Triangulation for park assist
