## Research Approach

Collecting and analysing non-numerical data such as text, video, or audio to understand concepts, opinions, or experiences.

Focuses on meaning.

Not as concerned with making generalisations to a larger population of interest.

Does not tend to rely on hypothesis testing.

It can be used to gather in-depth insights into a problem or generate new ides for research.

Researchers often use a mixed-methods approach.
