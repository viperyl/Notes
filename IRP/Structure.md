# 1. Introduction

Facial expression is an intuitive response to human emotion, and facial expression recognition has been one of the most important research topics in computer vision. In the last two decades, the researchers have achieve important results in various facial expression recognition problems.



Micro-facial expression only last in 0.04 to 0.3 seconds, and the muscle 

The magnitude of the movement is very small and does not occur in both the upper and lower half of the face [16, 18], making it difficult to correctly observe and identify.

## 2.1 Facial Expression

Facial expression is the most powerful, natural and universal signals for human beings to convey their emotional states and intention [1]. Facial expression recognition has been one of the most important research topics in computer vision due to its versatility and practicality [need some papers here]. 

The facial expression research can date back to 1872, where Darwin first proposed that facial expressions of emotion are universal and described variations in related emotions [2]. In 1971, Ekman and Friesen brings the milestone work of facial expression recognition (FER) [3]. They summarized 6 basic human facial expressions (happiness, sadness, fear, anger, disgust and surprise) and systematically establish a facial expression image database. The database meticulously describing how the facial changes corresponding to each expression, including eyebrows, eyes, eyelids, lips change.

However, human emotions are very complex, and the expressions conveyed through faces are difficult to be absolutely defined into a specific category, so Ekman’s taxonomy of facial expression do not reflect the real human emotions well in practical scenarios. To address this problem, Du et al. proposed the concept of compound facial expression, While Li et al. open-sourced the RAF-DB dataset of facial expression in their natural state with compound expressions.



Meanwhile, Wang et al and Liang proposed different fine-grained facial expression taxonomy approaches and constrcuted realted datasets, respectively. The proposed concept of compound and fine-grained expressions can indeed help computers to understand human expressions mode deeply, for example, to distinguish between happily surprised and fearfully surprised. However, the defined expression categories is still limited, and there is no way to reflect the intenity of a certain emotion in this way, for instance, very happy is difficult to distinguish from extremely happy. Therefore, in response to the above problems, many researchs have considered using a continous model to define expression labels.











Spontaneous expression recognition is one of the main trend in facial expression recognition, due to spontaneous expression cannot be faked or suppressed, and can reflect the real emotion of a person. Microexpressions are spontaneous expression that arise when a person tries to
conceal his or her emotions and can neither be faked nor suppressed. 

Compare with expression studies, the microexpression research have short history. The concept of microexpression was first introduced in 1966 by Haggard et al, while Ekman et al first reported cases of microexpressions in 1969. In a conversation between a psycgiatrist and a depressed patient , the 









Compared with expression studies, the history of microexpression discovery is relatively The history of microexpression discovery is shorter than that of expression research. The concept of microexpressions was first introduced in 1966 by Haggard et al. Haggard et al. first introduced the concept of micro-expressions in 1966 [10], after which Ekman et al. reported cases of micro-expressions [11]. In a conversation between a psychiatrist and a depressed patient [11], the patient with frequent micro-expressions occasionally had a few frames of very smiling patients occasionally had a few frames of very distressed expressions. Researchers have identified this rapid, unconscious, spontaneous facial movement that occurs when a person is experiencing strong emotions. researchers call these rapid, unconscious, spontaneous facial movements when a person is experiencing strong emotions microexpressions.
