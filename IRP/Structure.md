# 1. Introduction

Facial expression is an intuitive response to human emotion, and facial expression recognition has been one of the most important research topics in computer vision. In the last two decades, the researchers have achieve important results in various facial expression recognition problems.



Micro-facial expression only last in 0.04 to 0.3 seconds, and the muscle 

The magnitude of the movement is very small and does not occur in both the upper and lower half of the face [16, 18], making it difficult to correctly observe and identify. 



微表情的持续时间非常短, 研究表明微表情仅 持续 1/25 s ∼ 1/3 s[18] , 且动作幅度非常小, 不会同 时在上半脸和下半脸出现[16, 18] , 因此正确观测并且 识别有着相当的难度.
