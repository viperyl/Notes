During our testing, we found that the robot would get stuck right underneath some of the chairs

The camera provides a larger field of view.

It can help the robot to find the ground ahead and update the local costmap in time to avoid damage to the robot or cause the delay of the mission.

50 - 60 % CPU usage.

40 - 50 % for us

30 - 40 % for real

because we need leave 10% for redundancy.

If there are no redundancy for ROS, the system may stuck in robot movement. During the stuck, the Data flow may be misaligned and not synchronized. Which can lead to robot position drift.
