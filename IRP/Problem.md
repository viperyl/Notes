# AI based estimation of the Mood of a Crowd

Develop a system that can estimate the general mood of a crowd. The aim of this project is to develop a system that uses machine vision to provide a real-time estimate of the general mood of a crowd of people. The system should be able to analyse facial expressions (or other aspects of body language) of people walking past a camera. The system should also be able to analyse multiple faces simultaneously and display the results as a dynamic estimate. Results should be logged for historical analysis, e.g. to be cross-referenced with other data to attempt to explain mood trends. GDPR should be considered.
