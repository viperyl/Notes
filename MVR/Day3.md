# Image Transformation

Type of the Transformation

1. Point transformation
2. Local transformation
3. Global transformation

Aims

1. remove image degradations
2. improve image appearance
3. identify image features
4. transform image to alternative representations

Transform space: Real or Fourier

Real space filters: Linear processes which operate on the image data directly in real space (pixel)

Fourier space filters: Operate on the image transformed using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
