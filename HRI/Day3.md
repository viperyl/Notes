## Objectives

1. Communication in HRI and HRC
2. What is a human-robot interface
3. How do we define an intuitive user interface
4. Good and bad designs
5. Perspective taking
6. Social signal processing
7. Verbal and non-verbal communication



## How do they interact with each other

1. Physical interaction
2. Nature of information exchange (Control panel, speech, gesture, tactile/haptic, posture, Gaze)
3. Robot learning



## Human-machine interface

It is a type of user interface

The space where interactions humans and machines occur

Allow effective operation and control of the machine by the human



## Natural User Interface

Feel natural to the user

1. A paradigm shift in human-machine interaction
2. To create seamless interaction between the human and machine
3. Rely on a user being able to carry out relatively natural motions
4. Focuses on traditional human abilities
5. Focuses on traditional human abilities (touch, vision, speech, handwriting, motion, cognition)

## Information exchange

1. text-based user interfaces
2. graphical user interfaces
3. graphical - hand and facial movement
4. speech and natural language
5. brain interface
6. teleoperation/telemanipulation
7. telepresence

## Intuitive Interfaces

1. Gesture control
2. Eye Gaze
3. speech/voice control
4. haptic control
5. mind control



## Good design

### Usability

1. Efficient to use
2. easy to learn
3. effective to use
4. safe to use
5. remember how to use
6. good utility
7. enjoyable user experience

## Affordance

Affordances are visual clues in the design. They imply how users should interact with something.

A designer needs to design a product while making its affordances explicit. 

A designer needs to incorporate user expectations and cultural perceptions.
