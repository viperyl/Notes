# Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)

**Definition**: It addresses the understanding, design and evaluation of robotics systems that involve humans and robot interacting through communication.

**Goal:** To achieve more natural and effective interaction between humans and robots.

## HRI and HCI (human-computer interaction)

Robots could be affected by the followings

1. Environment 
2. Sensor failures
3. Mechanical failures
4. Other system failures
5. Accuracy and repeatability

Different roles of interaction are possible

Multiple people can interact in different roles with same robot

Robot acts based on “world model”
