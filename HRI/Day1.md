# Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)

**Definition**: It addresses the understanding, design and evaluation of robotics systems that involve humans and robot interacting through communication.

**Goal:** To achieve more natural and effective interaction between humans and robots.

## HRI and HCI (human-computer interaction)

Robots could be affected by the followings

1. Environment 
2. Sensor failures
3. Mechanical failures
4. Other system failures
5. Accuracy and repeatability

Different roles of interaction are possible

Multiple people can interact in different roles with same robot

Robot acts based on “world model”



## Safe HRI

There are three standards here.

1. a robot may not injure a human being, or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm
2. a robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law
3. a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws





## Consideration for developing an HRI System

What: type of situation/application, what are the available solutions

Where: the operating environment

When: the type of circumstances and timescale for development

Who: target users/ human-robot team composition

Why: the reasons for interaction/current issues

How: do they interact with each other? system capability requirements.
