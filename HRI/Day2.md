# Interaction design and Human-Robot Collaboration

HRI: human-robot interaction

HRC: human-robot collaboration





## 2. Differentiation between HRI and HRC

1. Different level of human interaction depending on the task
2. The necessity to consider the environment that the interaction takes place in
3. The dynamic nature of robots and their tendency to malfunction (fault)



## 3. HRC

### 3.1 Interaction

Collaboration: A process in which two or more participants coordinate their actions toward achieving shared goals.

Most collaboration between humans involves communication.

people (one or more) and robot (one or more) doing something together.

### 3.2 Design topics

**Human-centered Design**

Develops solutions to problems by involving the human perspective in all steps of the problem-solving process

**Community-Centered Design**

An approach that scales up the consolidated methods and tools of User Centered Design to community size
