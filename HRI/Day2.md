# Interaction design and Human-Robot Collaboration

HRI: human-robot interaction

HRC: human-robot collaboration





## 2. Differentiation between HRI and HRC

1. Different level of human interaction depending on the task
2. The necessity to consider the environment that the interaction takes place in
3. The dynamic nature of robots and their tendency to malfunction (fault)



## 3. HRC

### 3.1 Interaction

Collaboration: A process in which two or more participants coordinate their actions toward achieving shared goals.

Most collaboration between humans involves communication.

people (one or more) and robot (one or more) doing something together.

### 3.2 Design topics

**Human-centered Design**

Develops solutions to problems by involving the human perspective in all steps of the problem-solving process

**Community-Centered Design**

An approach that scales up the consolidated methods and tools of User Centred Design to community size

**Interaction Design**

The practice of designing interactive digital products, environments, systems and services.

**Service Design**

Improving the service quality and the interaction between the service provider and its customers

## 4. User intent

### 4.1 How do robots know

Through knowledge, observation and guesswork

### 4.2 Where the environment

Where are these people when they perform their tasks or having interactions

Which physical characteristic of that environment affect how they perform their tasks

Lighting conditions, temperature, noise, interruptions, privacy, space, interactions with other people, physical movement, and other conditions of the location could influence how they perform tasks.

What are the 

## 5. Level of autonomy



## 6. Design a HRI system

The system engineering approach

1. Examine systems from many perspectives

2. Exploit systems engineering skills

   Plan, Management, Analysis, Design, Implementation, Evaluation, Validation.
