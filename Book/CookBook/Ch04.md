# Yield from

## 简化for

```python
def gene():
    for c in "AB":
        yield c
    for i in range(3):
        yield i
```

```python
def gene():
    yield from "AB"
    yield from range(3)
```

## 链接 iterable object

```python
def chain(*args):
    for i in args:
        yield from i
        
list(chain("1234", "AV", [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]))
```



## 扁平化处理数据

```python
from collections.abc import Iterable
def flatten(items, ignore_types=(str, bytes)):
    for x in items:
        if isinstance(x, Iterable) and not isinstance(x, ignore_types):
            yield from flatten(x)
        else:
            yield x
items = [1, 2, [3, 4, [5, 6,], 7], 8]

for x in flatten(items):
    print(x)
```
